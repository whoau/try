					<h2>XI'AN GEOMEMBRANE MANUFACTURERS:GEOMEMBRANE LAYING AFFACTED BY TEMPERATURE</h2>
					<p class="messa"><span>AUTHOR:ORIGNAL</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>TIME:2017-6-27</span></p>
					<p class="text">Our geomembrane manufacturers have a professional team of geomembrane laying, perennial construction, a wealth of construction experience, due to the temperature level, the laying of geomembrane affected by the weather is very large, such as the rain, the wind affects the pavement, low temperature How to pavement Geomembrane made in accordance with national standards and special requirements made, of course, is affected by the climate, just like landfill it, we have a dedicated laying construction program can be fast and good but also to ensure the quality of use , Basically close to the life of the cement pool. In this sense, high quality dedicated membranes combined with scientific methods of construction are the prerequisites for a dedicated membrane to be strongly promoted. The popularization and application of this method not only greatly reduces the cost. And, we will provide you with a professional building construction fingers</p>
					<p class="messag">Geomembrane Features:</p>
					<p>1, high anti-seepage coefficient - with ordinary anti-seepage effect of waterproof material incomparable, HDPE geomembrane has high strength tensile mechanical, its excellent elasticity and deformation ability make it very suitable for expansion or contraction of the base, which can effectively overcome Uneven surface sedimentation.</p>
					<p>2, chemical stability - has excellent chemical stability, is widely used in sewage treatment, chemical reaction ponds, landfills. High and low temperature resistance, asphalt, oil and tar, acid, alkali, salt, etc. More than 80 kinds of acid and alkali corrosion of chemical media</p>
					<p>3, anti-aging properties - has excellent anti-aging, anti-UV, anti-decomposition ability, can be exposed to use, the material life of 50-70 years, for environmental impermeability to provide a good material assurance</p>
					<p>4, anti-plant roots-HDPE geomembrane has excellent anti-puncture ability, can resist most plant roots</p>
					<p>5, high mechanical strength - geomembrane has good mechanical strength, tensile strength at break 28Mpa, elongation at break of 700%</p>
					<p>6, low cost-high-HDPE geomembrane with a new technology to improve the seepage control effect, but the production process more scientific and speedy, so the cost of the product is lower than the traditional waterproof material, the actual calculation of the general project to use HDPE geomembrane to save About 50% cost</p>
					<p>7, the construction speed - geomembrane has a high degree of flexibility, there are a variety of specifications of a variety of laying forms to meet the requirements of different projects seepage, the use of hot-melt welding, weld strength, construction convenience, fast health</p>
					<p>8, environmental non-toxic - Geomembrane materials used are non-toxic environmentally friendly materials, impermeable principle is an ordinary physical changes, does not produce any harmful substances, is the best choice for environmental protection, aquaculture, drinking pools</p>
